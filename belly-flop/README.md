## Belly Baskets

Have A ponderful day in the middle east, in the middle ages.

Dark windy shadows /bc no sun or numbers.
Oh numbers /w there don't get me /w
..
Numbers just d/t add up.

So stop looking at /m numbers,
And start looking at my shadow.


Wind fell through cracks.
/T dice /vs /T plop
Yes, and yes they fought.
Wind get's to dice\y sometimes.
Sometime\s it plop\s though.


Here\ have a plant, it's root based.
The root's span acroos \t display.
The root's are old \a wise.
Yes, and yes it takes a \l \t \t \e.
For a A looong looooooong time.
A very looong time. ok.
That's why they called the root\s

Good, have a \root now.
\a always be planking.
maybe you can overrule the shadows.
